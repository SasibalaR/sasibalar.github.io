<p>I like doodling to escape fixing bugs in my code. Some of these doodles are based on science to explain away the time I spend on them.</p>

<h2 id="glasgow-pg-seminars-2024-2025">Glasgow PG Seminars 2024-2025</h2>
<p>As PhD students here, we took an oath to always talk about math. Especially for the important cause of having fun. The <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pgseminar/home">Glasgow PG Seminars</a> has been the home to one such weekly set of talks. Some drawings from my first term attending them can be <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pgseminar/art-work">found here</a>. The next term’s artworks were made into a whimsical comic panel/book as <a href="\pg_seminars_may2025.pdf">linked here</a>.</p>
