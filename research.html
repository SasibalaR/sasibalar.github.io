  <h1 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h1>

<p>My research lies at the intersection of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spatial Statistics</li>
  <li>Bayesian Modelling</li>
  <li>Causal Inference</li>
</ul>

<p>I currently work on novel ways to respresnt spatial pattern in disease risk in the context of the Glasgow Effect.
I am also interested to work with models that can help inform health policies and combat health inequalities.</p>
