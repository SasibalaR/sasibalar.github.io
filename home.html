<p>Hello! I’m <strong>Meyvizhi</strong>- a 1st-year PhD candidate in the School of Mathematics and Statistics, at <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/">UoG</a>. I am jointly supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/craiganderson/home">Dr. Craig Anderson</a>, <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/vanessamcnealis/">Dr. Vanessa McNealis</a> and <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/danielacastrocamilo/">Dr. Daniela Castro-Camilo</a>.</p>

<p>With a focus on disease risk mapping, I am working on spatial models to help answer important questions on health outcome inequalities. With <a href="https://sites.google.com/math.iith.ac.in/sayanteejana/team-members">previous experience</a> in infectious disease modelling, I now work on chronic diseases risks. Previous academic experience is a Bachelors in Statistics and Mathematics, which allowed me to explore both theory and applications.</p>

<p>Passionate about science outreach, I also help coordinate talks and workshops as a co-organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-bangalore/?msockid=249ea3195d2e6f811d22b60a5c546e13">R-Ladies Bangalore</a> chapter. Caricature-ising technical research into digestible cartoons is another way I attempt to engage with science outreach. More information on my background can be found in my <a href="\Meyvizhi_CV_Oct_25.pdf">CV</a>.</p>

<p>I am always open to hearing about cool science, books (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774964-a-man-called-ove">A Man Called Ove</a> is a good read) and food reccomendations(<a href="https://centraltiffinroom.com/">Masala Dosas</a>)!</p>
